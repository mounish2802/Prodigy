Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

Overview

Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption is a simple image encryption tool that uses pixel manipulation techniques to encrypt and decrypt images. This tool allows users to perform operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical operations to each pixel, ensuring that the original image can be securely encrypted and later decrypted.

Features

Encryption: Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.

Decryption: Restore the original image by reversing the pixel manipulation process.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface for easy encryption and decryption.

Support for Multiple Image Formats: Works with popular image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Pillow library for image processing

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/aadi28yash/PRODIGY-CS-04.git

How It Works

Encryption:

Pixel Swapping: Pixels within the image are swapped based on a predefined pattern or key. Mathematical Operations: Basic mathematical operations (such as adding a constant value) are applied to each pixel to alter its value.

Decryption:

The decryption process reverses the pixel manipulation operations to restore the original image.
